# Varied
Variety of projects when I first start learning Java

1. "IsSquare" - get inputs from the user to build rows and columns and displays rather is a magic square or not.
2. "LottoCentre" - create 10 players and give to them 250,00 canadian dolars to buy tickets. The award depends on how many number was matched.
   "Ticket" - class responsible for the tickets
   "Player" - class responsible for the players
3. "Pascal" - Gets input(number of lines) from the user to build a Pascal Triangle.
4. "PrintInt" - asks user an interger and coverts in binary, Octal, Hexadecimal and reciprocal.
5. "PrintRandomString" - only prints random numbers length of 10.
